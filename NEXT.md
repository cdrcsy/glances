# Manage UI

* Probably at `/manage`
* Tiles will need to generate forms for configuration
* Mis- or Unconfigured tiles must not be show (or maybe show with an error?)
* Search plugin repo (Probably just npm packages tagged `glances`)

# Scheduler

Right now the scheduler runs in intervals (eg, every 2 min). It might be useful  to have a callback happen at a certain time, similar to cron.
