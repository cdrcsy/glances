## Demo

Demo: https://glances-example.herokuapp.com/

## Overview

Glances is designed to be displayed on a monitor and works primarily over websockets. Built with React and Socket.io for lightning fast updates.

## Usage

1. `npm install -S glances-app`
2. `echo "require('glances-app')()" > server.js`
3. Add tiles to `tiles/`
4. Start your server: `npm start`

And remember: it's just JavaScript, there's nothing fancy here.

## Tile Anatomy

A tile may be either a function or an object and include the following keys:

* title
* value
* moreInfo
* color
* position
* display (see Tile Layouts below)

Example:

```javascript
module.exports = function(emit) {
  every('5 minutes', function (next) {
    emit({
      name: 'Test',
      value: isUp ? 'âœ“' : ':(',
      color: isUp ? 'green' : 'red'
    })
    next()
  })

  return {
    name: 'Test'
  }
}
```

Tip: Treat your tile objects as immutable to avoid sneaky bugs.

## Tile Layouts

Currently supported tile layouts:

* standard
* ticker
* list

For ticker and list types, pass a key/value object, a flat array, or an array of pairs as the `value`.

## TODO

* [ ] More robust scheduler
* [x] More robust value types based on data structures or setting
* [x] Dynamic tile routes to POST data
* [x] Pluggable, reusable tiles (should be possible currently, but need to investigate)
* [ ] Management UI to search, install, and configure tiles

See [NEXT.md](NEXT.md) for brainstorming on upcoming todos.

## Prior Art

Glances was inspired by, and borrows heavily from [Dashing](http://dashing.io/) by Shopify.
